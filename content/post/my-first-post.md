Well, here we go again. It's been a really long time since I blogged. Third time is the charm as they say.
Long story short, I've lost this blog 2 times now and because of other priorities, I didn't get around to rebuilding it. But I'm doing it now and its here to stay.

I built the first version of my blog when I was learning C# and ASP.NET sometime in 2009. It was a challenge, an opportunity to learn something new. I think the best way to learn something new is to try to build something that exists. I would say It was a great decision, as a good part of my career revolved around that technology and what I started to learn by building my own blog engine.

Moving to present day, I learned also a few things while putting it together again.
I loved the simple paradigm that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) had to offer and I was convinced : convention based static website generation based on markdown files.

In the next post, I'll document all the details on how I set it up including the techology choises for hosting, deploying and enabling SSL.
