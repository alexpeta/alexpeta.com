*2021*

Thinking about the past year, I get mixed memories of deja-vu from 2020. The last 2 years have had the same slow perceived velocity. Pandemic, stay at home, masks, isolation and a lot of work from home.
The plan for myself and and my family, like anyone else, was to get back to "normal" this year.
But going back meant we adapted and changed to live with it.
We are extremely fortunate to be able to live our lives and function almost the same with the help of the digital technology. We can socialize, order food, play games, be productive and work remotely.
But it has become obvious to me that health, both physical and mental has been the most impacted.

*Mental Health and Physical Health*

During 202(0)1, I personally have gained weight, lost interest in exercising even though I had more time ( no more comute to work to sit in traffic ), and I developed some unhealthy eating habits: the craving for sugar. A similar behavior change happed to my wife and other aquaintances too.
I have been thinking about this more and more and the answer that I can give is stress and anxiety coupled with explicit lockdown.

Health should be the most important asset that we have as it pertains to the most important tool that we own: our body.
You know you should eat less sugar. You know you need to exercise more. You know you need to meditate and limit binge-watching or long video gaming sessions. You know, you know, you know.
But it's been a very challenging year and you're probably stuck in a rut - almost everyone is, I know I am - and you dont know how to get your mojo back.

Behavioral Scientist BJ Fogg, PhD, wrote in his book titled ["Tiny Habits"](https://tinyhabits.com/) (published in 2020) about this topic and that you need to stop blaming yourself. There is no panacea, no magic product that will make things better. It's you, yourself, making small behavioral adjustments one (small) step at a time which eventually lead to long term healthier choices.

*Unemployment and the mind*

During a part of 2021, I was unable to work. Not because of any issues with myself, but because I was stuck in an immigration work permit process that, inefficient as it normally is in my opinion, got almost to the brink of colapse due to lack of funding at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the world of software engineering, we regularly do stress testing. It's part of the pyramid of testing which describes all the layers and types of testing that a software product must undergo in order to meet high levels of quality.
COVID-19 can be considered the best stress test of stress tests on all the public and private systems,and systems that did not have the appropriate means to scale and function in a remote first world, would need to shutdown in person services, lose revenue, cut staff and downscale operations and all of this would mean processing times would exponentially grow.

This meant I had to wait, not knowing how long and stay at home mostly, some of it in a lockdown.
When all of a sudden you have this seemingly "free" time on your hands, it must be the great right?  
The answer dependes on how you utilize it.


For myself, I tried a few things:

* Kept my mind busy and healthy. Exercise is key alog with meditation or any other form of midnfullness. Even playing a video game when you are fully connected in the present and emersed.
* Eat Good quality food. This does not mean expensive food. It means going for organic choices and making sure the diet is well balanced.
* Spend quality time with people - socialize whenever you can
* Take on learning opportunitites with small projects - for me this was picking up electronics.

I am very grateful to have a to be able to function as a whole ( at work and outside work) in a digital environment but the social social connection that we need and crave will never be replaced.
